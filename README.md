# ðŸ“ƒ Advance Java Practiceâ›³

## Description:
This repository contains a collection of Advanced Java practice programs, covering essential concepts to build robust, enterprise-level applications. 
It serves as a hands-on resource for mastering backend development, database connectivity, and server-side programming.
This repository contains a collection of Advanced Java practice programs, covering essential topics such as JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), JSP (Java Server Pages), Servlets, Multithreading, Networking, and more.
It is designed to help developers gain hands-on experience with server-side Java programming, database integration, and enterprise-level Java concepts.

## Topics Covered:
âœ… Core Java â€“ OOPs, Exception Handling, Collections, Multithreading.<br>
âœ… JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) â€“ Connecting Java with MySQL, CRUD operations, Prepared Statements.<br>
âœ… JSP (Java Server Pages) â€“ Dynamic web pages, JSTL, Expression Language (EL), MVC Architecture.<br>
âœ… Servlets â€“ Handling HTTP requests, Session Management, Cookies, Request Dispatching.<br>
âœ… Java Beans â€“ Reusable Java components, Encapsulation, Getter/Setter Methods.<br>
âœ… Multithreading & Concurrency â€“ Threads, Executors, Synchronization, Deadlock Prevention.<br>
âœ… Networking in Java â€“ Socket Programming, Client-Server Communication.<br>
âœ… JPA & Hibernate (ORM) â€“ Object-Relational Mapping, Annotations, Entity Classes.<br>
âœ… Spring Framework (Optional) â€“ Spring MVC, Dependency Injection, Spring Boot Basics.<br>
âœ… Web Application Development â€“ Building Dynamic Websites using Java EE Technologies.<br>

## How to Run the Programs
### 1. Setting Up JDBC:
- Install MySQL and create a database.
- Configure the JDBC driver (MySQL Connector) in your Java project.
### Example JDBC Connection:
````
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(
    "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database",
    "root", "password"
);
````
### 2. Running a Servlet-Based Web App
- Install Apache Tomcat and configure it in your IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ).
- Deploy the .war file or run the project directly from the IDE.
### Access the web app via:
````
http://localhost:8080/your-app-name
````

## Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ Implement full-stack web applications using JSP, Servlets & Hibernate.<br>
ðŸ”¹ Add REST API development using JAX-RS.<br>
ðŸ”¹ Integrate Spring Boot for modern Java web applications.<br>
ðŸ”¹ Include microservices and cloud deployment examples.<br>
